Script Type:
    - (Class)
Inheritance?
    - YES
    - Parent class for module-specific 'build' classes.
Multiple classes?
    - YES
Descrption:
    Purpose - Contains the member functions that are responsible for the 
                module-specific operations for specific modules.
    Responsibilty - ctrl, skeleton, logic setups.  I can make changes to a 
                    rig system & add updates very easily.

Rule:
    '''
    * DON'T Have 'self.dm' variables accessed here within the class functions.
    It makes the managing of the raw data messy across two classes (system & build) 
    
    System[ModuleName] = no self.dm._raw_data
    Build[ModuleName] = yes self.dm._raw_data
